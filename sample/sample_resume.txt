- Wrote SQL ETL scripts to clean & join 10M+ records; delivered weekly sales dashboards in Power BI.

PROJECTS
Zero-Shot Skill Matcher (GitHub: github.com/subashkumar/skill-matcher)
- Extract JD noun-phrases with spaCy; used Hugging Face BART-MNLI zero-shot to rank resume skills.  
- Logged inference runs in MLflow; outputs CSV of top-N matches in < 5s.

Tweet Sentiment API (GitHub: github.com/subashkumar/tweet-sentiment)
- Fine-tuned DistilBERT on tweet_eval dataset; achieved F1 ≈ 0.86 in 3 minutes on CPU.  
- Packaged as Docker container with FastAPI endpoint; deployed on AWS ECS.

EDUCATION
B.E. in Computer Science | Anna University | 2020–2024
